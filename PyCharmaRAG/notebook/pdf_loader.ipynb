It has become a central tool in assessing coronary artery disease (CAD), estimating \\nrisk of myocardial infarction, and guiding management in many patients. \\nMyocardial infarction (MI), or heart attack, occurs when blood flow to a portion of the myocardium \\n(heart muscle) is abruptly reduced or cut off, usually by thrombus formation over a ruptured \\natherosclerotic plaque. The interplay between imaging (anatomic and functional), risk stratification, \\nand clinical decision-making is crucial. Using CCTA, clinicians try not only to detect stenoses but also \\nto characterize plaque vulnerability, predict risk, and guide preventive or interventional therapies. \\nFor a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) model, this document aims to be a semi-structured, \\ncomprehensive resource covering both the imaging modality (CCTA) and the disease entity (heart \\nattack), along with connections between them. \\n \\n2.

Glossary of Key Terms \\n• CCTA: Coronary CT Angiography \\n• CAD: Coronary Artery Disease \\n• Stenosis: Narrowing of a vessel \\n• Plaque: Atherosclerotic deposit in vessel wall \\n• Calcified plaque: Plaque with calcium component \\n• Noncalcified plaque: Soft plaque, lipid-rich \\n• Mixed plaque: Both calcified and noncalcified components \\n• Low-attenuation plaque (LAP): Plaque with low Hounsfield units (< ~30 HU) \\n• Positive remodeling: Vessel expands outward in presence of plaque \\n• Napkin-ring sign: Imaging sign suggestive of vulnerable plaque (low core + higher rim) \\n• Spotty calcification: Small calcific foci within plaque \\n• FFR (Fractional Flow Reserve): Ratio of maximal flow to theoretical maximum'),\n",
